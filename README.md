Hello!

My name is Jennifer, as you can probably guess, I am a dog enthusiast and am lucky enough to have one of these wonderful creatures in my home. He is called Benny and is the perfect mix of a royal Corgi and proud German shepherd (think German shepherd but with short legs).

Regarding myself, I am 20 years old and besides dogs love languages, reading, dancing and cooking. And I like to box, so you better not mess with me.

If you want to make me happy, some vegan sweet dishes are always appreciated.

That's all for now.
Cheers!
